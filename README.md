# bike-rebalancing

This repository includes codes in the implementation and simulation of our bike rebalaning algorithm that is prosed in the paper Dynamic Rebalancing with Clustering to Reduce Loss in Bike Sharing Systems.

More specifically,
- `SolveDRPO with ATLCC` contains an implementation of our algorithm.
- `compute_loss.py` is used in the computation of loss in simulations.

Note that, due to confidentiality issues, the data involved in the study is not included here. In codes, all lines where data should be read is replaced by placeholders and indicated.
